Digital Ocean (notes and dotfiles)
==================================

Here I sum up how to configure a VPS (virtual private server) running
Ubuntu GNU/Linux. I tried it with Digital Ocean, but it must be the same
with others too, like Linode, etc.

The original version of these notes was written for Ubuntu 14.04, but then
the notes were updated for Ubuntu 16.04. Both versions are available:

* [notes for Ubuntu 14.04](ubuntu_14_04.md)
* [notes for Ubuntu 16.04](ubuntu_16_04.md)
